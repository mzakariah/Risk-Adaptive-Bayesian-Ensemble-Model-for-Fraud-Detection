# Risk-Adaptive-Bayesian-Ensemble-Model-for-Fraud-Detection
. By leveraging RABEM (Risk-Aware Bayesian Ensemble Model)—a novel and scalable fraud detection framework, it outperformed the other state of the art models with a high accuracy of 99.4% and high F1 score of 98.2% ensuring that fraud detection remains effective even in highly imbalanced datasets and evolving fraud landscapes.
Traditional methods, while effective in specific scenarios, often suffer from computational inefficiencies, overfitting, lack of adaptability to emerging fraud patterns, and reliance on static feature engineering. RABEM addresses key challenges that previous methods fail to overcome, handles evolving fraud trends using GRUs for sequential pattern recognition, reduces computational cost by leveraging Nyström Approximation-based Gaussian Process and RPTree instead of expensive deep learning models, Improves fraud detection accuracy by integrating financial risk modeling with Black-Scholes Feature Engineering, enhances explainability and reliability with Bayesian Reliability Fusion, dynamically adjusting confidence scores based on past predictions, scales efficiently for large datasets (6 million+ transactions) while maintaining high fraud detection performance. Unlike conventional models that rely solely on supervised learning, RABEM integrates multiple perspectives on fraud detection, ensuring a dynamic, explainable, and computationally efficient approach.
